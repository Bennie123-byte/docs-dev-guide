== RISC-V Style guidelines
[style-guidelines]

Follow these basic formatting guidelines.

* Use _italic_ for new terms.
* Use `monospace` for filenames, directories, and paths.
* Put punctuation outside of quotes, unless you are quoting someone directly.
* Use `monospace` for inline code and commands.
* Use *`monospace bold`* for hex numbers. Hex numbers start with `0x`.
* Use *`monospace bold`* for binary numbers. Binary numbers start with `0b`.
* Use *`monospace bold`* for any literals.
* Any number range, use regular font.

See the next section for rules about referring to a CSR.

[[csr-rules]]
=== Referring to CSRs or registers

Use the following guidelines when you document a CSR:

* CSR must always be capitalized.
* When plural, lowercase the `s`. CSRs.
* Register is capitalized in title, but lowercase in text. "Supervisor Status (`sstatus`) Register”. But “The `sstatus` register…”
* When in doubt, use "CSR" to indicate the type of register. You can then intermingle CSR and register in the text. So "The `misa` CSR is used to...." And then later in the paragraph, you can use "register". As in, "This register also does this other thing."
* In a title, the format is “Long name (`short name`) Register. All other references in that section can use the short name, but it must be in tics. So "Supervisor Status (`sstatus`) Register”. The rest of the references to that register can be "the `sstatus` CSR".
* Avoid starting a sentence with a CSR name.
* As a general rule, whenever you use a term in tics, it should be followed by what the thing is to help with translation. So avoid statements like this:  “`misa` also helps distinguish different variants of a design.”  And instead use this: “The `misa` CSR also helps distinguish different variants of a design.”
* Fields for registers are formatted in this style: `register`.FIELD. For example, `sstatus`.SPP.

=== General best practices


This section contains suggested best practices for clear, concise, and consistent content.

[[bp-present]]
==== Use present tense

|No

|Cache-management operation instructions perform operations on copies of data in the memory hierarchy.
|Cache-management operation instructions will perform operations on copies of data in the memory hierarchy.

Exception: Use future or past tense if it is required to convey the correct meaning.

[[bp-active]]
==== Use active voice

|The RVWMO memory model can be used...

|The RVWMO memory model enables architects.
|Architects are enabled by the RVWMO memory model.
|===

Exception: Use passive voice if active voice leads to an awkward construction.

[[bp-simple]]
==== Use simple and direct language

Use simple and direct language. Avoid using unnecessary phrases, such as saying "please."

[[bp-latin]]
==== Avoid Latin phrases

Prefer English terms over Latin abbreviations.

[[bp-patterns]]
=== Patterns to avoid

[[bp-we]]
==== Avoid using "we"

Using "we" in a sentence can be confusing, because the reader might not know whether they're part of the "we" you're describing.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Yes
|No

|Version 1.4 includes ...
|In version 1.4, we have added ...

|RISC-V provides a new feature for ...
|We provide a new feature ...

|This page teaches you how to create CSRs.
|In this page, we are going to learn about CSRs.
|===

An exception for using "we" is the rationale sections.

[[bp-jargon]]
==== Avoid jargon and idioms

Some readers speak English as a second language. Avoid jargon and idioms to help them understand better.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Yes
|No

|Internally, ...
|Under the hood, ...

|Stop trying.
|Chutar o pau-da-barraca (which translates to "kicking away the tent pole")
|===

[[bp-future]]
==== Avoid statements about the future

Avoid making promises or giving hints about the future. If you need to talk about an alpha feature, put the text under a heading that identifies it as alpha information.

An exception to this rule is documentation about announced deprecations targeting removal in future versions.

[[bp-out-of-date]]
==== Avoid statements that will soon be out-of-date

Avoid words like "currently" and "new." A feature that is new today might not be considered new in a few months.

[[bp-assume]]
==== Avoid words that assume a specific level of understanding

Avoid words such as "just", "simply", "easy", "easily", or "simple". These words do not add value and can actually make a user feel stupid.
